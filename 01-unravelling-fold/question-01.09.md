# Question 1.9

> Comment on whether the use of folds in each of Questions 1â€“7 is good style.

---

It seems to be a good idea for Questions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.7.
For Question 1.5 it is better to implement `mem` using logical short-circuiting.
For Question 1.6 it is better to use the built-in function `String.concat`.
